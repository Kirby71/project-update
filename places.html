    <h1>Places to Mountain Bike</h1>
    <h2>1. Moab, Utah, USA</h2>
    <img class="place" src="Moab.jpeg" alt="">
    <br><br>
    <p>Moab has been a part of mountain bike culture since the early days of the sport. It’s the place to go to ride the latest bikes on some of the toughest trails, and to hang out with
        riders from around the world. While there are only a few truly beginner-friendly trails in Moab, riders can access a variety of trails from flowy to 
        slabby and technical, and from forested high alpine singletrack to wide-open desert trails. Surrounded by vast and scenic public lands, there are many options for camping and 
        sightseeing as well.

    <br><br>
    <p>The Whistler Mountain Bike Park is the number one lift-accessed bike park in the world, and however you get your fix, this place will have something for you.
        With more than 4,926 vertical feet of lift-serviced, gravity-fed, adrenaline-fueled downhill trails —from easy-cruisin’ greens to expert-only double blacks—you 
        choose how you want to experience it.

    <br><br><br>
    <p> Northwest Arkansas, offers every type of riding you can imagine, from pump tracks to singletracks to massive jump lines and features. Just about the only thing Bentonville doesn’t
        have is lift-serviced terrain, though there are shuttle operators who are more than willing to help you save your legs. Visitors will find quality trails in Bentonville of all flavors,
        built by some of the most accomplished and creative trail builders from around the country.

    <h2>Sedona, Arizona, USA</h2>
    <img class="place" id="right" src="sedona.jpeg" alt="">
    <br>
    <p> It took some time before the word got out among mountain bikers, but today it’s no secret that Sedona is one of the best places to ride in the US. With incredible scenery 
        and some of the best early-season weather, it’s become a must-ride destination for both casual and experienced riders alike. Visitors have so many great trails to ride in
        Sedona thanks in large part to the work of the Verde Valley Cyclist Coalition. The group is active in supporting trail maintenance and new trail builds, and helping staff 
        the unofficial kick-off to the US mountain bike season, the Sedona Bike Festival.
