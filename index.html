    <p class="centered">Mountain biking, also commonly known as "MTB" is the sport in which someone rides a bike offroad. There are many different kinds of MTB such as Cross-Country, downhill, trail and enduro.
     It requires endurance, speed, balance and technical skills to navigate through rough terrains. Unlike road bikers, mountain bikers pursue obstacles and see the world as a natural 
     and challenging playground full of winding trails. Vertical downhill sections, steep ascents, loose rocks, water crossings, tree roots
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="centered" > Mountain bikes differ from other bikes primarily in that they incorporate features aimed at increasing durability and improving performance in rough terrain. 
        Most modern mountain bikes have some kind of suspension, 26, 27.5 or 29-inch diameter tires, usually between 1.7 and 2.5 inches in width, and a wider, flat or 
        upwardly-rising handlebar that allows a more upright riding position, giving the rider more control. They have a smaller, reinforced frame, usually made of wide tubing.
        Tires usually have a pronounced tread, and are mounted on rims which are stronger than those used on most non-mountain bicycles. Compared to other bikes, mountain bikes also
        use hydraulic disc brakes. They also tend to have lower ratio gears to facilitate climbing steep hills and traversing obstacles.
