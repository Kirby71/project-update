    <h1>Kinds of Mountain Biking</h1>
    <p class="centered">While all the different types of mountain biking require fitness, skill and lightning-fast reactions, there are still significant differences between them.
        Some such as downhill favour gravity-fuelled descents, while cross-country racing is more about high-speed, high-energy riding over an intense couple of hours.
        Then there’s trail riding, which is more about going out and enjoying local tracks and routes for pleasure.
    </p>

    <h2>Downhill</h2>
    <img class="kinds" src="downhill.jpeg" alt="">
    <p class="centered">The name is a giveaway here; in downhill mountain bike racing, you start the track at the top of the mountain and race until you reach the bottom. 
        Whoever completes the race course in the quickest time wins. Events are usually held at mountain resorts, so riders can use chairlifts to get to the top of the mountain.
        It’s one of the most thrilling and risky disciplines of mountain bike racing, with riders reaching speeds of up to 80kmp(50mph) and often having to clear jumps that stretch up 
        to 19m(62 feet) long, or land off drops more than 3m(10 feet) high.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="centered">Downhill bikes are only meant for one thing: going downhill fast. They are completely optimized for the most challenging downhill trails, and if you try going uphill on one, 
        you’ll probably be better off walking. Downhill bikes generally have around 200mm of suspension travel and the burliest components. Brands make downhill-specific brakes, 
        drivetrains, and components because the requirements of downhill bikes are so specific and intense.

    <h2>Cross-Country(XC)</h2>
    <img class="kinds" src="xc.webp" alt="">
    <p class="centered">Cross-country is perhaps the most famous discipline in mountain biking as it’s the one you’ll see at the Olympic Games, though there are actually several sub-categories
        of cross-country racing. It’s all about fitness and stamina, with cross-country race courses involving steep climbs and technical descents with features such as rock-gardens,
        rollers and drops. The courses aren’t as technical as downhill tracks, but riders have to exert maximum effort for the entire duration of the race.
    </p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p class="centered">Cross-country bicycles are some of the lightest mountain bikes, typically between 7.5 and 12.5 kilograms (17 and 28 lb). They usually feature suspension forks
         in front and often have suspension in the rear. The geometry of the frames generally places the rider in a little more upright position than on a road bicycle but much less 
         than on a downhill bike which allows for more nimble handling and better climbing characteristics along with a more comfortable pedaling position at the expense of stability,
          especially when going downhill.
    </p>

    <h2>Trail</h2>
    <img class="kinds" src="trail.webp" alt="">
    <p class="centered">
        Trail riding and the corresponding trail bikes refer to what can be thought of as ‘everyday’ mountain bike riding. Trail bikes are designed to have as much fun as
        possible on any given terrain and be just as capable on the climbs as they are on the descents. Trail bikes have traditionally been thought of as jack of all trades bikes.
        Though if the trail bikes of yesteryear were masters of none, technological advancements have made them masters of a lot.
